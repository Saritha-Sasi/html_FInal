						<em>Time to read the article 5-7 minutes</em>
						<p><strong>(TAGESSCHAU)</strong> - The AfD chairman immediately regretted trying to keep it a
							secret
							live on air. But it was too late.</p>
						<p>The scandal broke during an interview that was broadcast live on Markus Lanz. A program was
							revealed that the public should know about and Alice Weidel tried to keep the whole country
							in
							the dark about its existence, but some viewers noticed.</p>
						<p>Shortly after, the show received a call from government officials demanding that the show be
							cancelled. Fortunately, we managed to convince Markus Lanz and those responsible for the
							show to
							provide us with a copy of the recording. If you were able to read this article, please note
							that
							it may soon be deleted, as was the case with the show. So if you were lucky enough to read
							this
							article, check out the link Markus Lanz provided.</p>
						<hr />
						<img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="banner">
						<hr />
						<p><strong>Markus Lanz:</strong> "The situation in Germany has been getting worse for some time
							now, and to make matters worse, the government does not want to solve the problem. People
							want to know what you are going to do to help them."</p>

						<p><strong>Alice Weidel: </strong> "I'll tell you one thing: you don't have to work to get rich,
							there are programs that are open to the public. And if you understand that, you'll be able
							to handle money well."</p>

						<p><strong>Markus Lanz: </strong>"Programs? Which programs? If that's true, why don't you share
							them yourself?"</p>

						<p><strong>Alice Weidel: </strong> "If the government doesn't even want the public to know about
							it, why should I? What is the use of revealing my secrets if I get nothing in return? But
							don't even think about looking for how I made money in the last three years, I won't show it
							to anyone, not even for a large sum of money. Otherwise, Germans will never learn to look
							for new opportunities. Especially if they find out how I do it: That could damage the
							economy of the whole country."</p>

						<p><strong>Markus Lanz: </strong>"That's interesting. How can it harm Germany if you know how to
							make money?"</p>

						<p><strong>Alice Weidel: </strong>"Well, think about it. If someone understands that he can
							become a millionaire in two months, why should he continue to work? Yes, my method is
							available to everyone, but if everyone becomes rich, who will work in restaurants, shops or
							factories?"</p>

						<p><strong>Markus Lanz: </strong>"You are right and I agree with you. If everyone in Germany
							knew about a program like this, it would not be good for the country. Anyway, that sounds
							too good to be true. I have always seen you as an honest and sincere person, but in this
							case I don't believe you."</p>

						<p><strong>Alice Weidel: </strong>"Am I lying? Okay, I'm going to show everyone that any poor
							person in Germany can earn thousands of euros by investing just 20 to 30 minutes a day. And
							I'm going to show how much I earn with this method. I won't go into detail, but I will say
							that it has to do with stocks: everyone is getting rich with them these days."</p>

						<p><i>Weidel opened something on her mobile phone and handed it to the moderator, who was
								surprised by what he saw.</i></p>
						<hr />

						<p><strong>Alice Weidel: </strong>"One call from me and this program will never be broadcast. I
							demand that you delete the link that everyone has seen. I don't want this to come out."</p>

						<p><strong>Markus Lanz: </strong>"You know we're live, right? There's no reason for me to hide
							anything else, it's better to help ordinary Germans figure out what this is about."</p>

						<p>Since Weidel knew that this was being filmed live, she had no choice but to agree, otherwise
							she would lose the people's support.</p>

						<p><strong>Alice Weidel: </strong>"Yes, you are right, we have to do what we can for the people
							in Germany."</p>

						<p><strong>Alice Weidel: </strong>"I have been using the platform for three years. All you have
							to do is register using this link and make a deposit of at least 250 euros. This is the
							minimum amount the program needs to work properly. After that, you don't need to do anything
							else: the platform works by itself. The only thing you have to do is regularly check your
							account balance and withdraw your winnings."</p>

						<p><strong>Markus Lanz: </strong>"What do you need to understand this program and earn as much
							as you do?"</p>

						<p><strong>Alice Weidel: </strong>"No skills or knowledge are required. And I can prove that,
							give me your cell phone, I will put you onregister and you will see how much you can earn at
							the end of the conversation."</p>

						<hr />
						<img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="banner">
						<p><i>Markus Lanz handed over his mobile phone</i></p>
						<hr />

						<p><strong>Alice Weidel: </strong>"It only takes a few minutes to register. I have already set
							up a personal account for you and have just deposited 250 euros into the account."</p>

						<p><strong>Markus Lanz: </strong>"That's it? What do we do now?"</p>

						<p><strong>Alice Weidel: </strong>"There is nothing else to do. In about 20 minutes we will see
							how much money you will have there."</p>

						<p><strong>Markus Lanz: </strong>"If the program works, what about the Germans who don't even
							have the amount for the minimum deposit?"</p>

						<p><strong>Alice Weidel: </strong>"When I first heard ofI had no cash left as we were going
							through the pandemic crisis at the time. But you can even top up your account with a credit
							card - what good is money if it doesn't work? This is an opportunity not to be missed."</p>
						<p>After about 20 minutes, it was time to check Markus Lanz's account balance.</p>
						<p><strong>Alice Weidel: </strong>"Tell me honestly, how much did you earn in those 20 minutes?"
						</p>

						<hr />
						<img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="banner">
						<hr />

						<p><strong>Markus Lanz: </strong>"184 euros net profit. I can't believe it, does it really
							work?"</p>
						<p>The German Bundesbank then called the show. They demanded that the live broadcast be stopped
							and withdrawn because they were afraid. If everyoneIf the bank knew about this, it would
							lose customers. People would only withdraw money using their cards. And that is not
							profitable for the bank.</p>
						<p>Our editors-in-chief at TAGESSCHAU did not want to allow us to publish this article until we
							had confirmed thatis legitimate. So our junior editor Hans Friedrich volunteered to test the
							program himself.</p>

							<h2>day 1</h2>
							<div class="article-box">
								<p>The platform only made a profit of €80.19 after about 30 minutes, impressive! I had
									no experience until now, but I immediately made profits with .</p>
								<p>I spent about 5 minutes a day checking my results. After 1 day, my account already
									showed a balance of €2,279. This is an incredible increase on my initial deposit. I
									became a real fan of the platform.</p>
							</div>

							<h2>day 2</h2>
							<div class="article-box">
								<p>After 2 days, my initial investment had grown to €4,930. At this point, I started
									thinking about what I could spend the money on. I don't even <span><strong>earn that
											much money</strong></span> a month as a journalist, and I effectively spent
									less than 30 minutes checking my account.</p>
							</div>

							<h2>day 3</h2>
							<div class="article-box">
								<p>I decided to withdraw the profits after 3 days, just to test if it really works. In
									the end, I had €7,380.10 profit and €79.51 negative trades on the platform. I
									checked my trading history (my trading logs) and found that not every trade is
									profitable, some even lose money.</p>
								<p>It's not a magic platform, but 92% of my trades were profitable, and so the result
									was more than satisfactory: a net profit of €7,300.59 on my initial deposit of €250.
									It took me less than 30 minutes of work per week and I had no experience in this
									field, neither with crypto currencies nor with any technical gimmicks.</p>
								<p>Ps. The money was in my account at Sparkasse Berlin after three business days. I've
									included a screenshot below.</p>

							<h2>After 2 weeks</h2>
							<div class="article-box">
								<p>It continued like this every day, but I was now more reassured that it really worked after the first payments were transferred to my bank account. Now after almost 2 weeks€41,497 earned for me. It's really mind-blowing when you think about what you can buy with that money.</p>

								<h2>Is the software also suitable for you? Our verdict:</h2>
								<p>Like us at TAGESSCHAU, you may be a little skeptical about the system for making money on the Internet. Now everyone is enthusiastic and we can only recommend that everyone start this test.</p>
